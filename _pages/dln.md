Title: My Journey into Digital Humanities

Starting the Digital Humanities program at my university marked an important change in my academic path. As a 20-year-old student, I could use digital tools pretty well, mostly for social media and basic software likes Word and Excel. This essay will explain step-by-step how I grew through studying digital humanities. It covers the more complex tools I now use, new skills I gained, areas I still need to improve, new ways of understanding data, and what I learned working with AI.

**Skills I Had & What I Learned** 

At first, I mainly used digital tools like Instagram, WhatsApp, Google Drive and Microsoft Word for school and my social life. These helped me get daily work done. But my digital humanities classes expanded what I can do a lot. Now I use GitHub to collaboratively code through its version control features. I build websites on WordPress since it allows flexible content editing. And I harness RNotebooks, which combine statistics and stories with images, to present humanities data compellingly.  

**New Digital Humanities Tools**

Markdown has become essential for easily writing documents. Voyant Tools let me deeply analyze texts, revealing patterns and links between words and ideas that I couldn’t see before. Orange is great for data mining, so I can apply machine learning to interpret large datasets. And Kepler allows me to encode and study location and time data from books and history.  

**What I Still Need to Improve**  

Despite improving my skills, I know I have more learning ahead. I especially need to keep strengthening data analysis abilities, using machine learning and advanced statistics well. I still find these areas difficult as I try to keep up with fast technological innovations.

**New Ideas on Understanding Data**  

Studying digital humanities across different fields gave me chances to explore combining quantitative and qualitative methods. This led me to rethink data not just as numbers, but as conveying human expression, culture and history. Engaging with digital humanities made me respect interpreting data as much more complex, with many layers of meaning hidden in what might first appear as basic figures.   

**Working With AI**

Collaborating with artificial intelligence was an eye-opening part of my learning adventure. Humans’ creativity together with AI’s computing power let us explore untouched research areas, while also critically inspecting human perspectives in the digital era. This synergy gave me a vision for technology’s endless possibilities, while equipping me to take advantage of them.  

**Ethics & Future Goals**  

My digital humanities work wasn’t only about gaining tech skills; I also had to deeply consider ethical issues in digital scholarship. As algorithms and data analysis spread, it’s crucial we use them responsibly. So ensuring fair content access, minimizing algorithmic bias, and promoting inclusion online have become pillars of my research principles.  

Recognizing these duties sparked me to put ethics at the heart of my digital humanities practice. As I dig deeper into this field, I remain dedicated to responsible scholarship that respects and celebrates humanity’s diversity.   

**Conclusion**   

In summary, my digital humanities studies have been both an academic effort and a profound personal and intellectual journey. The program expanded my perspectives, questioned my assumptions, and equipped me with adaptable digital tools. It reshaped how I see data as encapsulating the whole range of human experiences. This adventure was marked by moments of revelation and self-reflection, with ever-present AI acting as both a motivator and companion in my research.  

As I navigate the changing digital humanities landscape, I’m committed to constant learning and meaningfully contributing to the broader conversation on merging digital technology and humanities questions. I expect this lifelong journey will span my whole academic career. I embark optimistically that my efforts will grow my understanding and leave a lasting positive mark on this field and society.
